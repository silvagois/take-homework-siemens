# Code Documentation

This code is designed to process a set of user records, filter those who logged in before a cutoff date, and find the pair of logins closest in time. Below is the description of each function and its purpose:

## Class `Question2`

### `__init__(self, records, cutoff_date)`
**Purpose:** Initializes the class with user records and sets the cutoff date for filtering logins.

**Arguments:**
- `records` (list): A list of dictionaries containing user IDs and their last login dates.
- `cutoff_date` (str): The cutoff date in ISO8601 format (`"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z"`).

**Functionality:**
- Converts the `cutoff_date` to a `datetime` object without timezone information.
- Filters the records using the `_filter_records()` method and stores the results in `self.filtered_records`.

---

### `_filter_records(self)`
**Purpose:** Filters the records to include only those whose last login occurred before the cutoff date.

**Returns:**
- `list`: A list of dictionaries containing the `id` and `last_login` of the filtered users.

**Functionality:**
- Iterates over the records and converts the `last_login` string to a `datetime` object.
- Compares the last login date with the cutoff date and includes only the records that meet the criteria.

---

### `get_closest_pair(self)`
**Purpose:** Finds the pair of logins closest in time within the filtered records.

**Returns:**
- `tuple`: A tuple containing two dictionaries representing the users with the closest logins. Returns `None` if there are fewer than two filtered records.

**Functionality:**
- Sorts the filtered records by the last login date.
- Calculates the time difference between each pair of consecutive logins.
- Returns the pair with the smallest time difference.

---

## Function `load_json(filename)`

**Purpose:** Loads a JSON file and returns its contents.

**Arguments:**
- `filename` (str): Name of the JSON file.

**Returns:**
- `list`: List of records loaded from the JSON file.

**Functionality:**
- Opens the JSON file in read mode and loads the data using the `json` library.

---

## Main Execution (`if __name__ == "__main__":`)

**Purpose:** Executes the main code to load records, filter them, and find the pair of closest logins.

**Functionality:**
- Loads records from the file `../records.json`.
- Sets the cutoff date to `"2025-02-01T00:00:00+0000"`.
- Creates an instance of the `Question2` class with the records and the cutoff date.
- Calls the `get_closest_pair()` method to find the pair of closest logins.
- Displays the IDs and login dates of the closest pair.

---

# Example Output

If the code runs successfully, the output will look something like this:

```
Closest pair IDs: 123 456
Login times: 2025-01-31 23:59:00 2025-01-31 23:59:30
```

---

# How to Use

1. Ensure the `records.json` file is in the correct path (`../records.json`).
2. Run the Python script.
3. The script will display the IDs and login dates of the closest pair that meets the cutoff date criteria.

---

# Structure of `records.json`

The `records.json` file should contain a list of dictionaries in the following format:

```json
[
    {"id": 123, "last_login": "2025-01-31T23:59:00Z"},
    {"id": 456, "last_login": "2025-01-31T23:59:30Z"},
    ...
]
```

# Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `json` library (native to Python)
- `datetime` library (native to Python)
